The goal of the tags is to help extract and digest information from the papers, and therefore they should be precise, descriptive, but not overly so.

There are three categories:
1 - Area(s) of application
2 - Mathematical tool(s) used
3 - Input type(s)

Each paper must have at least one tag for each category. The tags should be in lower-case letter unless they are acronyms. 
Each paper should be tagged as precisely as possible with the consideration that too unique tags are not necessarily useful. 
Therefore the precision needs to be calibrate with the grouping of very similar tags. 
They should be arranged hierarchically, using colon separation between the levels, from the most general to the most specific (as a rule of thumbs, three levels should be used). 
To write a tag in Zotero, use the format "# - tag".
For example, if the input type is a CAT scan, two tags for the input type(s) can be 
3 - image:2d image:CAT scan
3 - image:grayscale image:CAT scan

Tags #2 do not restrict to TDA methods, but encompass any mathematical tools used.

Two additional flavour can added: "innovate" and "confirm", written as this, without number of hyphen.
It is not required that each paper has a flavour. 
"innovate" means that TDA is bringing something new to the specific domain, for example more information, or same information from smaller/easier to obtain inputs.
"confirm" means that TDA is provably an alternative method to obtain information that previous techniques were also able to obtain.
