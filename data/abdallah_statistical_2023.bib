 abstract = {Time-series data are amongst the most widely-used in biomedical sciences, including domains such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}). Structure within time series data can be captured by the tools of topological data analysis ({TDA}). Persistent homology is the mostly commonly used data-analytic tool in {TDA}, and can effectively summarize complex high-dimensional data into an interpretable 2-dimensional representation called a persistence diagram. Existing methods for statistical inference for persistent homology of data depend on an independence assumption being satisfied. While persistent homology can be computed for each time index in a time-series, time-series data often fail to satisfy the independence assumption. This paper develops a statistical test that obviates the independence assumption by implementing a multi-level block sampled Monte Carlo test with sets of persistence diagrams. Its efficacy for detecting task-dependent topological organization is then demonstrated on simulated {fMRI} data. This new statistical test is therefore suitable for analyzing persistent homology of {fMRI} data, and of non-independent data in general.},
