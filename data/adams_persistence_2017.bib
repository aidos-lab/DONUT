 abstract = {Many data sets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an underlying space, and tools from topological data analysis can characterize this structure for the purpose of knowledge discovery. One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram ({PD}). Efforts have been made to map {PDs} into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a {PD} to a finite-dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image ({PI}), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of {PIs} is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of {PIs} with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of {PIs}.},
