 abstract = {Due to the growth in the number of texts and documents available online, machine learning based text classification systems are getting more popular recently. Feature extraction, converting unstructured text into a structured feature space, is one of the essential tasks for text classification. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction approach for text classification using the network representation of text, network topology, and machine learning techniques. We present experimental results on classifying the Holy Quran chapters based on the place each chapter was revealed to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},
