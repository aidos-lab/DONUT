 abstract = {We introduce topological differential testing ({TDT}), an approach to extracting the consensus behavior of a set of programs on a corpus of inputs. {TDT} uses the topological notion of a simplicial complex (and implicitly draws on richer topological notions such as sheaves and persistence) to determine inputs that cause inconsistent behavior and in turn reveal {\textbackslash}emph\{de facto\} input specifications. We gently introduce {TDT} with a toy example before detailing its application to understanding the {PDF} file format from the behavior of various parsers. Finally, we discuss theoretical details and other possible applications.},
