 abstract = {Biological membranes play key roles in cellular compartmentalization, structure, and its signaling pathways. At varying temperatures, individual membrane lipids sample from different configurations, a process that frequently leads to higher-order phase behavior and phenomena. Here we present a persistent homology-based method for quantifying the structural features of individual and bulk lipids, providing local and contextual information on lipid tail organization. Our method leverages the mathematical machinery of algebraic topology and machine learning to infer temperature-dependent structural information of lipids from static coordinates. To train our model, we generated multiple molecular dynamics trajectories of {DPPC} membranes at varying temperatures. A fingerprint was then constructed for each set of lipid coordinates by a persistent homology filtration, in which interactions spheres were grown around the lipid atoms while tracking their intersections. The sphere filtration formed a simplicial complex that captures enduring key topological features of the configuration landscape, using homology, yielding persistence data. Following fingerprint extraction for physiologically relevant temperatures, the persistence data were used to train an attention-based neural network for assignment of effective temperature values to selected membrane regions. Our persistence homology-based method captures the local structural effects, via effective temperature, of lipids adjacent to other membrane constituents, e.g. sterols and proteins. This topological learning approach can predict lipid effective temperatures from static coordinates across multiple spatial resolutions.
