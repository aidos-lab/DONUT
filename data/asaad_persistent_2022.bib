 abstract = {An Important tool in the field topological data analysis is known as persistent Homology ({PH}) which is used to encode abstract representation of the homology of data at different resolutions in the form of persistence diagram ({PD}). In this work we build more than one {PD} representation of a single image based on a landmark selection method, known as local binary patterns, that encode different types of local textures from images. We employed different {PD} vectorizations using persistence landscapes, persistence images, persistence binning (Betti Curve) and statistics. We tested the effectiveness of proposed landmark based {PH} on two publicly available breast abnormality detection datasets using mammogram scans. Sensitivity of landmark based {PH} obtained is over 90\% in both datasets for the detection of abnormal breast scans. Finally, experimental results give new insights on using different types of {PD} vectorizations which help in utilising {PH} in conjunction with machine learning classifiers.},
