 abstract = {Quantitative features that can currently be obtained from medical imaging do not provide a complete picture of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ({COPD}). In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical tool based on persistent homology that extracts quantitative features from chest {CT} scans to describe the geometric structure of the airways inside the lungs. We show that these new radiomic features stratify {COPD} patients in agreement with the {GOLD} guidelines for {COPD} and can distinguish between inspiratory and expiratory scans. These {CT} measurements are very different to those currently in use and we demonstrate that they convey significant medical information. The results of this study are a proof of concept that topological methods can enhance the standard methodology to create a finer classification of {COPD} and increase the possibilities of more personalized treatment.},
