 abstract = {Modern lean premixed combustors are operated in ultra-lean mode to conform to strict emission norms. However, this causes the combustors to become prone to lean blowout ({LBO}). Online monitoring of combustion dynamics may help to avoid {LBO} and help the combustor run more safely and reliably. Previous studies have suggested various techniques to early predict {LBO} in single-burner combustors. In contrast, early detection of {LBO} in multi-burner combustors has been little explored to date. Recent studies have discovered significantly different combustion dynamics between multi-burner combustors and single-burner combustors. In the present paper, we show that some well-established early {LBO} detection techniques suitable for single-burner combustor are less effective in early detecting {LBO} in multi-burner combustors. To resolve this, we propose a novel tool, topological data analysis ({TDA}), for real-time {LBO} prediction in a wide range of combustor configurations. We find that the {TDA} metrics are computationally cheap and follow monotonic trends during the transition to {LBO}. This indicates that the {TDA} metrics can be used to fine-tune the {LBO} safety margin, which is a desirable feature from practical implementation point of view. Furthermore, we show that the sublevel set {TDA} metrics show approximately monotonic changes during the transition to {LBO} even with low sampling-rate signals. Sublevel set {TDA} is computationally inexpensive and does not require phase-space embedding. Therefore, {TDA} can potentially be used for real-time monitoring of combustor dynamics with simple, low-cost, and low sampling-rate sensors.},
