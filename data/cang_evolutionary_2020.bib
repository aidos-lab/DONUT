 abstract = {While the spatial topological persistence is naturally constructed from a radius-based ﬁltration, it has hardly been derived from a temporal ﬁltration. Most topological models are designed for the global topology of a given object as a whole. There is no method reported in the literature for the topology of an individual component in an object to the best of our knowledge. For many problems in science and engineering, the topology of an individual component is important for describing its properties. We propose evolutionary homology ({EH}) constructed via a time evolution-based ﬁltration and topological persistence. Our approach couples a set of dynamical systems or chaotic oscillators by the interactions of a physical system, such as a macromolecule. The interactions are approximated by weighted graph Laplacians. Simplices, simplicial complexes, algebraic groups and topological persistence are deﬁned on the coupled trajectories of the chaotic oscillators. The resulting {EH} gives rise to time-dependent topological invariants or evolutionary barcodes for an individual component of the physical system, revealing its topology-function relationship. In conjunction with Wasserstein metrics, the proposed {EH} is applied to protein ﬂexibility analysis, an important problem in computational biophysics. Numerical results for the B-factor prediction of a benchmark set of 364 proteins indicate that the proposed {EH} outperforms all the other state-of-the-art methods in the ﬁeld.},
