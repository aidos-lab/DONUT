 abstract = {Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia ({ALL}) is the most frequent paediatric cancer. Modern therapies have improved survival rates, but approximately 15-20 \% of patients relapse. At present, patients’ risk of relapse are assessed by projecting high-dimensional flow cytometry data onto a subset of biomarkers and manually estimating the shape of this reduced data. Here, we apply methods from topological data analysis ({TDA}), which quantify shape in data via features such as connected components and loops, to pre-treatment {ALL} datasets with known outcomes. We combine these fully unsupervised analyses with machine learning to identify features in the pre-treatment data that are prognostic for risk of relapse. We find significant topological differences between relapsing and non-relapsing patients and confirm the predictive power of {CD}10, {CD}20, {CD}38, and {CD}45. Further, we are able to use the {TDA} descriptors to predict patients who relapsed. We propose three prognostic pipelines that readily extend to other haematological malignancies.
