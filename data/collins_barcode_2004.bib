 abstract = {In this paper, we present a complete computational pipeline for extracting a compact shape descriptor for curve point cloud data ({PCD}). Our shape descriptor, called a barcode, is based on a blend of techniques from differential geometry and algebraic topology. We also provide a metric over the space of barcodes, enabling fast comparison of {PCDs} for shape recognition and clustering. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement our pipeline and provide experimental evidence in shape classification and parametrization.},
