 abstract = {The cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) of 19 subjects who received a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) as well as of 5 pathological controls was collected and analyzed by Raman spectroscopy ({RS}). We investigated whether the raw and preprocessed Raman spectra could be used to distinguish {AD} from controls. First, we applied standard Machine Learning ({ML}) methods obtaining unsatisfactory results. Then, we applied {ML} to a set of topological descriptors extracted from raw spectra, achieving a very good classification accuracy ({\textgreater}87\%). Although our results are preliminary, they indicate that {RS} and topological analysis may provide an effective combination to confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis of {AD}. The next steps include enlarging the dataset of {CSF} samples to validate the proposed method better and, possibly, to investigate whether topological data analysis could support the characterization of {AD} subtypes.},
