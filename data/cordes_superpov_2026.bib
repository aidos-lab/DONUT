 abstract = {Classifying the stratospheric polar vortex provides predictability for surface weather on extended-range timescales definitions of these events proposed in over 60 years of study depend on empirically chosen parameters and yield different results when one of them changes. Moreover, as previous definitions are based on static thresholds, it is not straightforward to use them to study the spatiotemporal evolution of the vortexe introduce {SuPerPoV}, a score system that computes displacement and split ratiossing tools from applied topology. The computation is entirely threshold-free, open source, and does not require familiarity with applied topology. The scores generally recovers previous definitions and are output for a user-defined number of days, thus showing the evolution of the event. {SuPerPoV} offers a paradigm shift in the study of the polar vortex, hopefully bringing a deeper understanding of the polar vortex and related extreme events, such as sudden stratospheric warmings.},
