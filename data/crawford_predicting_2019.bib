 abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) is an aggressive form of human brain cancer that is under active study in the field of cancer biology. Its rapid progression and the relative time cost of obtaining molecular data make other readily available forms of data, such as images, an important resource for actionable measures in patients. Our goal is to use information given by medical images taken from {GBM} patients in statistical settings. To do this, we design a novel statistic—the smooth Euler characteristic transform ({SECT})—that quantifies magnetic resonance images of tumors. Due to its well-defined inner product structure, the {SECT} can be used in a wider range of functional and nonparametric modeling approaches than other previously proposed topological summary statistics. When applied to a cohort of {GBM} patients, we find that the {SECT} is a better predictor of clinical outcomes than both existing tumor shape quantifications and common molecular assays. Specifically, we demonstrate that {SECT} features alone explain more of the variance in {GBM} patient survival than gene expression, volumetric features, and morphometric features. The main takeaways from our findings are thus 2-fold. First, they suggest that images contain valuable information that can play an important role in clinical prognosis and other medical decisions. Second, they show that the {SECT} is a viable tool for the broader study of medical imaging informatics.
