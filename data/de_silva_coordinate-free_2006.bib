 abstract = {Tools from computational homology are introduced to verify coverage in an idealized                 sensor network. These methods are unique in that, while they are coordinate-free and                 assume no localization or orientation capabilities for the nodes, there are also no                 probabilistic assumptions. The key ingredient is the theory of homology from                 algebraic topology. The robustness of these tools is demonstrated by adapting them                 to a variety of settings, including static planar coverage, 3-D barrier coverage,                 and time-dependent sweeping coverage. Results are also given on hole repair, error                 tolerance, optimal coverage, and variable radii. An overview of implementation is given.},
