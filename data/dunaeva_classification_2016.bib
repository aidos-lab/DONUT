 abstract = {Aiming at the automatic diagnosis of tumors using narrow band imaging ({NBI}) magnifying endoscopic ({ME}) images of the stomach, we combine methods from image processing, topology, geometry, and machine learning to classify patterns into three classes: oval, tubular and irregular. Training the algorithm on a small number of images of each type, we achieve a high rate of correct classifications. The analysis of the learning algorithm reveals that a handful of geometric and topological features are responsible for the overwhelming majority of decisions.},
