 abstract = {Recent {fMRI} research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data analysis ({TDA}) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology, that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several recent studies have successfully applied {TDA} to study various forms of neural data; however, to our knowledge, {TDA} has not been successfully applied to data from event-related {fMRI} designs. Event-related {fMRI} is very common but limited in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether persistent homology—a popular {TDA} tool that identifies topological features in data and quantifies their robustness—can identify known signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a
Python-based simulator of realistic {fMRI} data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover topological structure embedded in realistic {fMRI} data simulations.How do we represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of high-dimensional data. Topological data analysis ({TDA}) holds promise for detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although potentially useful, {TDA} has not been applied to event-related {fMRI} data. Here we utilized a popular tool from {TDA}, persistent homology, to recover topological signals from event-related {fMRI} data. We simulated realistic {fMRI} data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and recommendations for how to make the most out of {TDA} for {fMRI} analysis.},
