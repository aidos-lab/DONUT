 abstract = {In this paper we use {TDA} mapper alongside with deep convolutional neural networks in the classification of 7 major skin diseases. First we apply kepler mapper with neural network as one of its filter steps to classify the dataset {HAM}10000. Mapper visualizes the classification result by a simplicial complex, where neural network can not do this alone, but as a filter step neural network helps to classify data better. Furthermore we apply {TDA} mapper and persistent homology to understand the weights of layers of mobilenet network in different training epochs of {HAM}10000. Also we use persistent diagrams to visualize the results of analysis of layers of mobilenet network.},
