 abstract = {Where do ﬁrms innovate? Mapping their locations in technological space is diﬃcult, because it is high dimensional and unstructured. We address this issue by using a method in computational topology called the Mapper algorithm, which combines local clustering with global reconstruction. We apply this method to a panel of 333 major ﬁrms’ patent portfolios in 1976–2005 across 430 technological areas. Results suggest the Mapper graph captures salient patterns in ﬁrms’ patenting histories, and our measures of their uniqueness (the length of “ﬂares”) are correlated with ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performances in a statistically and economically signiﬁcant manner. We then compare this approach with a widely used clustering method by Jaﬀe (1989) to highlight additional ﬁndings.},
