 abstract = {Studies of highly and profoundly gifted children typically involve small sample sizes, as the population is relatively rare, and many statistical methods cannot handle these small sample sizes well. However, topological data analysis ({TDA}) tools are robust, even with very small samples, and can provide useful information as well as robust statistical tests.

This study demonstrates these capabilities on data simulated from previous talent search results (small and large samples), as well as a subset of data from Rufâ€™s cohort of gifted children. {TDA} methods show strong, robust performance and uncover insight into sample characteristics and subgroups, including the appearance of similar subgroups across assessment populations.},
