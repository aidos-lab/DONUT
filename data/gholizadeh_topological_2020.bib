 abstract = {While the strength of Topological Data Analysis has been explored in many studies on high dimensional numeric data, it is still a challenging task to apply it to text. As the primary goal in topological data analysis is to define and quantify the shapes in numeric data, defining shapes in the text is much more challenging, even though the geometries of vector spaces and conceptual spaces are clearly relevant for information retrieval and semantics. In this paper, we examine two different methods of extraction of topological features from text, using as the underlying representations of words the two most popular methods, namely word embeddings and {TF}-{IDF} vectors. To extract topological features from the word embedding space, we interpret the embedding of a text document as high dimensional time series, and we analyze the topology of the underlying graph where the vertices correspond to different embedding dimensions. For topological data analysis with the {TF}-{IDF} representations, we analyze the topology of the graph whose vertices come from the {TF}-{IDF} vectors of different blocks in the textual document. In both cases, we apply homological persistence to reveal the geometric structures under different distance resolutions. Our results show that these topological features carry some exclusive information that is not captured by conventional text mining methods. In our experiments we observe adding topological features to the conventional features in ensemble models improves the classification results (up to 5{\textbackslash}\%). On the other hand, as expected, topological features by themselves may be not sufficient for effective classification. It is an open problem to see whether {TDA} features from word embeddings might be sufficient, as they seem to perform within a range of few points from top results obtained with a linear support vector classifier.},
