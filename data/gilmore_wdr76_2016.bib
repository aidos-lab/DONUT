 abstract = {Proteins that respond to {DNA} damage play critical roles in normal and diseased states in human biology. Studies have suggested that the S. cerevisiae protein {CMR}1/{YDL}156w is associated with histones and is possibly associated with {DNA} repair and replication processes. Through a quantitative proteomic analysis of affinity purifications here we show that the human homologue of this protein, {WDR}76, shares multiple protein associations with the histones H2A, H2B, and H4. Furthermore, our quantitative proteomic analysis of {WDR}76 associated proteins demonstrated links to proteins in the {DNA} damage response like {PARP}1 and {XRCC}5 and heterochromatin related proteins like {CBX}1, {CBX}3, and {CBX}5. Co-immunoprecipitation studies validated these interactions. Next, quantitative imaging studies demonstrated that {WDR}76 was recruited to laser induced {DNA} damage immediately after induction, and we compared the recruitment of {WDR}76 to laser induced {DNA} damage to known {DNA} damage proteins like {PARP}1, {XRCC}5, and {RPA}1. In addition, {WDR}76 co-localizes to puncta with the heterochromatin proteins {CBX}1 and {CBX}5, which are also recruited to {DNA} damage but much less intensely than {WDR}76. This work demonstrates the chromatin and {DNA} damage protein associations of {WDR}76 and demonstrates the rapid response of {WDR}76 to laser induced {DNA} damage.},
