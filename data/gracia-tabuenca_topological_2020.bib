Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulty to control the own behavior. Neuroimaging studies have related {ADHD} with the interplay of fronto-parietal attention systems with the default mode network ({DMN}; Castellanos and Aoki, 2016). However, some results have been inconsistent, potentially due to methodological differences in the analytical strategies when defining the brain functional network, i.e., the functional connectivity threshold and/or the brain parcellation scheme. Here, we make use of topological data analysis ({TDA}) to explore the brain connectome as a function of the filtration value (i.e., the connectivity threshold), instead of using a static connectivity threshold. Specifically, we characterized the transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component as a function of the filtration value. We explored the utility of such a method to identify differences between 81 children with {ADHD} (45 male, age: 7.26–17.61 years old) and 96 typically developing children ({TDC}; 59 male, age: 7.17–17.96 years old), using a public dataset of resting state (rs){fMRI} in human subjects. Results were highly congruent when using four different brain segmentations (atlases), and exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with {ADHD}, both at the whole-brain network and the functional subnetwork levels, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the {DMN}. Therefore, this is a solid approach that complements connectomics-related methods and may contribute to identify the neurophysio-pathology of {ADHD}.},
