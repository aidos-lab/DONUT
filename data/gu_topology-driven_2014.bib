 abstract = {We design a probabilistic trajectory synthesis algorithm for generating time-varying sequences of geometric configuration data. The algorithm takes a set of observed samples (each may come from a different trajectory) and simulates the dynamic evolution of the patterns in O(n2 logn) time. To synthesize geometric configurations with indistinct identities, we use the pair correlation function to summarize point distribution, and α-shapes to maintain topological shape features based on a fast persistence matching approach. We apply our method to build a computational model for the geometric transformation of the cone mosaic in retinitis pigmentosa — an inherited and currently untreatable retinal degeneration.},
