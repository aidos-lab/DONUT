 abstract = {Cell complexes are topological spaces constructed from simple blocks called cells. They generalize graphs, simplicial complexes, and polyhedral complexes that form important domains for practical applications. We propose a general, combinatorial, and unifying construction for performing neural network-type computations on cell complexes. Furthermore, we introduce inter-cellular message passing schemes, message passing schemes on cell complexes that take the topology of the underlying space into account. In particular, our method generalizes many of the most popular types of graph neural networks.},
