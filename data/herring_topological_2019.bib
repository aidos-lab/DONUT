 abstract = {Results from a series of two-phase fluid flow experiments in Leopard, Berea, and Bentheimer sandstones are presented. Fluid configurations are characterized using laboratory-based and synchrotron based 3-D X-ray computed tomography. All flow experiments are conducted under capillary-dominated conditions. We conduct geometry-topology analysis via persistent homology and compare this to standard topological and watershed-partition-based pore-network statistics. Metrics identified as predictors of nonwetting fluid trapping are calculated from the different analytical methods and are compared to levels of trapping measured during drainage-imbibition cycles in the experiments. Metrics calculated from pore networks (i.e., pore body-throat aspect ratio and coordination number) and topological analysis (Euler characteristic) do not correlate well with trapping in these samples. In contrast, a new metric derived from the persistent homology analysis, which incorporates counts of topological features as well as their length scale and spatial distribution, correlates very well (R2 = 0.97) to trapping for all systems. This correlation encompasses a wide range of porous media and initial fluid configurations, and also applies to data sets of different imaging and image processing protocols.},
