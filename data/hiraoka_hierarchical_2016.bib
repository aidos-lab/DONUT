 abstract = {This article proposes a topological method that extracts hierarchical structures of various amorphous solids. The method is based on the persistence diagram ({PD}), a mathematical tool for capturing shapes of multiscale data. The input to the {PDs} is given by an atomic configuration and the output is expressed as 2D histograms. Then, specific distributions such as curves and islands in the {PDs} identify meaningful shape characteristics of the atomic configuration. Although the method can be applied to a wide variety of disordered systems, it is applied here to silica glass, the Lennard-Jones system, and Cu-Zr metallic glass as standard examples of continuous random network and random packing structures. In silica glass, the method classified the atomic rings as short-range and medium-range orders and unveiled hierarchical ring structures among them. These detailed geometric characterizations clarified a real space origin of the first sharp diffraction peak and also indicated that {PDs} contain information on elastic response. Even in the Lennard-Jones system and Cu-Zr metallic glass, the hierarchical structures in the atomic configurations were derived in a similar way using {PDs}, although the glass structures and properties substantially differ from silica glass. These results suggest that the {PDs} provide a unified method that extracts greater depth of geometric information in amorphous solids than conventional methods.},
