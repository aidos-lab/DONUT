 abstract = {Graph neural networks ({GNNs}) are a powerful architecture for tackling graph learning tasks, yet have been shown to be oblivious to eminent substructures, such as cycles. We present {TOGL}, a novel layer that incorporates global topological information of a graph using persistent homology. {TOGL} can be easily integrated into any type of {GNN} and is strictly more expressive in terms of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test of isomorphism. Augmenting {GNNs} with our layer leads to beneficial predictive performance, both on synthetic data sets, which can be trivially classified by humans but not by ordinary {GNNs}, and on real-world data.},
