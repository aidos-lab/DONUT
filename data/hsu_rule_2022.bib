 abstract = {System-level test ({SLT}) has recently gained visibility when integrated circuits become harder and harder to be fully tested due to increasing transistor density and circuit design complexity. Albeit {SLT} is effective for reducing test escapes, little diagnostic information can be obtained for product improvement. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning ({UL}) method to resolve the aforementioned issue by discovering correlative, potentially systematic defects during the {SLT} phase. Toward this end, {HDBSCAN} [1] is used for clustering {SLT} failed devices in a low-dimensional space created by {UMAP} [2]. Decision trees are subsequently applied to explain the {HDBSCAN} results based on generating explainable quantitative rules, e.g., inequality constraints, providing domain experts additional information for advanced diagnosis. Experiments on industrial data demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively cluster {SLT} failed devices and then explain the clustering results with a promising accuracy of above 90\%. Our methodology is also scalable and fast, requiring two to five orders of magnitude lower runtime than the method presented in [3].},
