 abstract = {Accurate estimation of recombination rates is critical for studying the origins and maintenance of genetic diversity. Because the inference of recombination rates under a full evolutionary model is computationally expensive, we developed an alternative approach using topological data analysis ({TDA}) on genome sequences. We find that this method can analyze datasets larger than what can be handled by any existing recombination inference software, and has accuracy comparable to commonly used model-based methods with significantly less processing time. Previous {TDA} methods used information contained solely in the first Betti number ({\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/211/4/1191/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/{\textgreater}) of a set of genomes, which aims to capture the number of loops that can be detected within a genealogy. These explorations have proven difficult to connect to the theory of the underlying biological process of recombination, and, consequently, have unpredictable behavior under perturbations of the data. We introduce a new topological feature, which we call ψ, with a natural connection to coalescent models, and present novel arguments relating {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/211/4/1191/embed/mml-math-2.gif"/{\textgreater} to population genetic models. Using simulations, we show that ψ and {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/211/4/1191/embed/mml-math-3.gif"/{\textgreater} are differentially affected by missing data, and package our approach as {TREE} (Topological Recombination Estimator). {TREE}’s efficiency and accuracy make it well suited as a first-pass estimator of recombination rate heterogeneity or hotspots throughout the genome. Our work empirically and theoretically justifies the use of topological statistics as summaries of genome sequences and describes a new, unintuitive relationship between topological features of the distribution of sequence data and the footprint of recombination on genomes.},
