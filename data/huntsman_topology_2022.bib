 abstract = {We give an idiosyncratic overview of applications of topology to cyber research, spanning the analysis of variables/assignments and control flow in computer programs, a brief sketch of topological data analysis in one dimension, and the use of sheaves to analyze wireless networks. The text is from a chapter in the forthcoming book Mathematics in Cyber Research, to be published by Taylor and Francis.},
