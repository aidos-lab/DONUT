 abstract = {The notion of a cellular complex which is well known in the topology is applied to describe the structure of images. It is shown that the topology of cellular complexes is the only possible topology of finite sets. Under this topology no contradictions or paradoxes arise when defining connected subsets and their boundaries. Ways of encoding images as cellular complexes are discussed. The process of image segmentation is considered as splitting (in the topological sense) a cellular complex into blocks of cells. The notion of a cell list is introduced as a precise and compact data structure for encoding segmented images. Some applications of this data structure to the image analysis are demonstrated.},
