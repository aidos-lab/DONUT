 abstract = {Glial scar formation represents a fundamental response to central nervous system ({CNS}) injuries. It is mainly characterized by a well-defined spatial rearrangement of reactive astrocytes and microglia. The mechanisms underlying glial scar formation have been extensively studied, yet quantitative descriptors of the spatial arrangement of reactive glial cells remain limited. Here, we present a novel approach using point pattern analysis ({PPA}) and topological data analysis ({TDA}) to quantify spatial patterns of reactive glial cells after experimental ischemic stroke in mice. We provide open and reproducible tools using R and Julia to quantify spatial intensity, cell covariance and conditional distribution, cell-to-cell interactions, and short/long-scale arrangement, which collectively disentangle the arrangement patterns of the glial scar. This approach unravels a substantial divergence in the distribution of {GFAP}+ and {IBA}1+ cells after injury that conventional analysis methods cannot fully characterize. {PPA} and {TDA} are valuable tools for studying the complex spatial arrangement of reactive glia and other nervous cells following {CNS} injuries and have potential applications for evaluating glial-targeted restorative therapies.},
