 abstract = {We present a cooperative grasping approach based on a topological representation of objects. Using point cloud data we extract loops on objects suitable for generating entanglement. We use the Gauss Linking Integral to derive controllers for multi-agent systems that generate hooking grasps on such loops while minimizing the entanglement between robots. The approach copes well with noisy point cloud data, it is computationally simple and robust. We demonstrate the method for performing object grasping and transportation, through a hooking maneuver, with two coordinated {NAO} robots.},
