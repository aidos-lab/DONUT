 abstract = {We describe a combinatorial streaming algorithm to extract features which identify regions of local intense rates of mixing in twoterascale turbulent combustion simulations. Our algorithm allows simulation data comprised of scalar fields represented on 728x896x512 or 2025x1600x400 grids to be processed on a single relatively lightweight machine. The turbulence-induced mixing governs the rate of reaction and hence is of principal interest in these combustion simulations. We use our feature extraction algorithm to compare two very different simulations and find that in both the thickness of the extracted features grows with decreasing turbulence intensity. Simultaneous consideration of results of applying the algorithm to the {HO}2 mass fraction field indicates that autoignition kernels near the base of a lifted flame tend not to overlap with the high mixing rate regions.},
