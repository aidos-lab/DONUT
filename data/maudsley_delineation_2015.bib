 abstract = {Biased G proteinâ€“coupled receptor agonists engender a restricted repertoire of downstream events from their cognate receptors, permitting them to produce mixed agonist-antagonist effects in vivo. While this opens the possibility of novel therapeutics, it complicates rational drug design, since the in vivo response to a biased agonist cannot be reliably predicted from its in cellula efficacy. We have employed novel informatic approaches to characterize the in vivo transcriptomic signature of the arrestin pathway-selective parathyroid hormone analog [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine {PTH}(7-34) in six different murine tissues after chronic drug exposure. We find that [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine {PTH}(7-34) elicits a distinctive arrestin-signaling focused transcriptomic response that is more coherently regulated across tissues than that of the pluripotent agonist, human {PTH}(1-34). This arrestin-focused network is closely associated with transcriptional control of cell growth and development. Our demonstration of a conserved arrestin-dependent transcriptomic signature suggests a framework within which the in vivo outcomes of arrestin-biased signaling may be generalized.},
