 abstract = {Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology ({PH}), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how {PH} can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an {AI}-generated image in the artist's style.},
