 abstract = {Background Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) is a complex disorder that is traditionally stratified based on clinical signs and symptoms. Recent imaging and molecular biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for improved {TBI} precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. Complete integration of these diverse data for {TBI} diagnosis and patient stratification remains an unmet challenge. Methods and findings The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury ({TRACK}-{TBI}) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute {TBI} patients and collected diverse common data elements ({TBI}-{CDEs}) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the {TBI}-{CDEs} collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis ({TDA}) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) {TDA}-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after {TBI} using more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. {TDA} algorithms organized and mapped the data of {TBI} patients in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild {TBI} patients with a specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and {DNA} damage ({PARP}1), and in striatal dopamine processing ({ANKK}1, {COMT}, {DRD}2). Conclusions {TDA} identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild {TBI} that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as {TDA} may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in {TBI} patients.
