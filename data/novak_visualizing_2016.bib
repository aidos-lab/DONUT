 abstract = {The identity of a consumer Internet of Things ({IoT}) assemblage emerges through a historical process of ongoing interactions among consumers, smart devices, and digital information. Topological Data Analysis ({TDA}), consistent with mathematical aspects of assemblage theory, is used to visualize the underlying possibility space from which individual {IoT} assemblages emerge.},
