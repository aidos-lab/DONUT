 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy for classification of hepatic tumors by characterization of T1-weighted magnetic resonance ({MR}) images using two radiomics approaches with machine learning models: texture analysis and topological data analysis using persistent homology. This study assessed non-contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images of 150 hepatic tumors. The lesions included 50 hepatocellular carcinomas ({HCCs}), 50 metastatic tumors ({MTs}), and 50 hepatic hemangiomas ({HHs}) found respectively in 37, 23, and 33 patients. For classification, texture features were calculated, and also persistence images of three types (degree 0, degree 1 and degree 2) were obtained for each lesion from the 3D {MR} imaging data. We used three classification models. In the classification of {HCC} and {MT} (resp. {HCC} and {HH}, {HH} and {MT}), we obtained accuracy of 92\% (resp. 90\%, 73\%) by texture analysis, and the highest accuracy of 85\% (resp. 84\%, 74\%) when degree 1 (resp. degree 1, degree 2) persistence images were used. Our methods using texture analysis or topological data analysis allow for classification of the three hepatic tumors with considerable accuracy, and thus might be useful when applied for computer-aided diagnosis with {MR} images.},
