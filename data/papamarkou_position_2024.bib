 abstract = {Topological deep learning ({TDL}) is a rapidly evolving field that uses topological features to understand and design deep learning models. This paper posits that {TDL} is the new frontier for relational learning. {TDL} may complement graph representation learning and geometric deep learning by incorporating topological concepts, and can thus provide a natural choice for various machine learning settings. To this end, this paper discusses open problems in {TDL}, ranging from practical benefits to theoretical foundations. For each problem, it outlines potential solutions and future research opportunities. At the same time, this paper serves as an invitation to the scientific community to actively participate in {TDL} research to unlock the potential of this emerging field.},
