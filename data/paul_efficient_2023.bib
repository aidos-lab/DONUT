 abstract = {Efficient multi-robot task allocation ({MRTA}) is fundamental to various time-sensitive applications such as disaster response, warehouse operations, and construction. This paper tackles a particular class of these problems that we call {MRTA}-collective transport or {MRTA}-{CT} - here tasks present varying workloads and deadlines, and robots are subject to flight range, communication range, and payload constraints. For large instances of these problems involving 100s-1000's of tasks and 10s-100s of robots, traditional non-learning solvers are often time-inefficient, and emerging learning-based policies do not scale well to larger-sized problems without costly retraining. To address this gap, we use a recently proposed encoder-decoder graph neural network involving Capsule networks and multi-head attention mechanism, and innovatively add topological descriptors ({TD}) as new features to improve transferability to unseen problems of similar and larger size. Persistent homology is used to derive the {TD}, and proximal policy optimization is used to train our {TD}-augmented graph neural network. The resulting policy model compares favorably to state-of-the-art non-learning baselines while being much faster. The benefit of using {TD} is readily evident when scaling to test problems of size larger than those used in training.},
