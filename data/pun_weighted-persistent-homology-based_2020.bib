 abstract = {With the great significance of biomolecular flexibility in biomolecular dynamics and functional analysis, various experimental and theoretical models are developed. Experimentally, Debye-Waller factor, also known as B-factor, measures atomic mean-square displacement and is usually considered as an important measurement for flexibility. Theoretically, elastic network models, Gaussian network model, flexibility-rigidity model, and other computational models have been proposed for flexibility analysis by shedding light on the biomolecular inner topological structures. Recently, a topology-based machine learning model has been proposed. By using the features from persistent homology, this model achieves a remarkable high Pearson correlation coefficient ({PCC}) in protein B-factor prediction. Motivated by its success, we propose weighted-persistent-homology ({WPH})-based machine learning ({WPHML}) models for {RNA} flexibility analysis. Our {WPH} is a newly-proposed model, which incorporate physical, chemical and biological information into topological measurements using a weight function. In particular, we use local persistent homology ({LPH}) to focus on the topological information of local regions. Our {WPHML} model is validated on a well-established {RNA} dataset, and numerical experiments show that our model can achieve a {PCC} of up to 0.5822. The comparison with the previous sequence-information-based learning models shows that a consistent improvement in performance by at least 10\% is achieved in our current model.},
