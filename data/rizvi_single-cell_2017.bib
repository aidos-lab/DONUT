 abstract = {Transcriptional programs control cellular lineage commitment and differentiation during development. Understanding cell fate has been advanced by studying single-cell {RNA}-seq, but is limited by the assumptions of current analytic methods regarding the structure of data. We present single-cell topological data analysis ({scTDA}), an algorithm for topology-based computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation. Compared to other methods, {scTDA} is a non-linear, model-independent, unsupervised statistical framework that can characterize transient cellular states. We applied {scTDA} to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell ({mESC}) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. {scTDA} resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time, and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, {RNA}-binding proteins and long non-coding {RNAs}. {scTDA} can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations.},
