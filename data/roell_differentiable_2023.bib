 abstract = {The \_Euler Characteristic Transform\_ ({ECT}) is a powerful invariant, combining geometrical and topological characteristics of shapes and graphs. However, the {ECT} was hitherto unable to learn task-specific representations. We overcome this issue and develop a novel computational layer that enables learning the {ECT} in an end-to-end fashion. Our method, the \_Differentiable Euler Characteristic Transform\_ ({DECT}) is fast and computationally efficient, while exhibiting performance on a par with more complex models in both graph and point cloud classification tasks. Moreover, we show that this seemingly simple statistic provides the same topological expressivity as more complex topological deep learning layers.},
