 abstract = {Fragile X syndrome ({FXS}), due to mutations of the {FMR}1 gene, is the most common known inherited cause of developmental disability as well as the most common single-gene risk factor for autism. Our goal was to examine variation in brain structure in {FXS} with topological data analysis ({TDA}), and to assess how such variation is associated with measures of {IQ} and autism-related behaviors. To this end, we analyzed imaging and behavioral data from young boys (n = 52; aged 1.57–4.15 years) diagnosed with {FXS}. Application of topological methods to structural {MRI} data revealed two large subgroups within the study population. Comparison of these subgroups showed significant between-subgroup neuroanatomical differences similar to those previously reported to distinguish children with {FXS} from typically developing controls (e.g., enlarged caudate). In addition to neuroanatomy, the groups showed significant differences in {IQ} and autism severity scores. These results suggest that despite arising from a single gene mutation, {FXS} may encompass two biologically, and clinically separable phenotypes. In addition, these findings underscore the potential of {TDA} as a powerful tool in the search for biological phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders.
