 abstract = {Background Osteoarthritis ({OA}) is a multifaceted disease with many variables affecting diagnosis and progression. Topological data analysis ({TDA}) is a state-of-the-art big data analytics tool that can combine all variables into multidimensional space. {TDA} is used to simultaneously analyze imaging and gait analysis techniques. Purpose To identify biochemical and biomechanical biomarkers able to classify different disease progression phenotypes in subjects with and without radiographic signs of hip {OA}. Study Type Longitudinal study for comparison of progressive and nonprogressive subjects. Population In all, 102 subjects with and without radiographic signs of hip osteoarthritis. Field Strength/Sequence 3T, {SPGR} 3D {MAPSS} T1ρ/T2, intermediate-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin-echo ({FSE}). Assessment Multidimensional data analysis including cartilage composition, bone shape, Kellgren–Lawrence ({KL}) classification of osteoarthritis, scoring hip osteoarthritis with {MRI} ({SHOMRI}), hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score ({HOOS}). Statistical Tests Analysis done using {TDA}, Kolmogorov–Smirnov ({KS}) testing, and Benjamini-Hochberg to rank P-value results to correct for multiple comparisons. Results Subjects in the later stages of the disease had an increased {SHOMRI} score (P {\textless} 0.0001), increased {KL} (P = 0.0012), and older age (P {\textless} 0.0001). Subjects in the healthier group showed intact cartilage and less pain. Subjects found between these two groups had a range of symptoms. Analysis of this subgroup identified knee biomechanics (P {\textless} 0.0001) as an initial marker of the disease that is noticeable before the morphological progression and degeneration. Further analysis of an {OA} subgroup with femoroacetabular impingement ({FAI}) showed anterior labral tears to be the most significant marker (P = 0.0017) between those {FAI} subjects with and without {OA} symptoms. Data Conclusion The data-driven analysis obtained with {TDA} proposes new phenotypes of these subjects that partially overlap with the radiographic-based classical disease status classification and also shows the potential for further examination of an early onset biomechanical intervention.
