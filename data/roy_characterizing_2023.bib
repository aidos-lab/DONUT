 abstract = {Euler characteristic    ( χ ), a topological invariant, helps to understand the topology of a network or complex. We demonstrate that the multi-scale topological information of dynamically evolving fluid flow systems can be crystallized into their Euler characteristic surfaces     χ s ( r , t ). Furthermore, we demonstrate the Euler Metric ({EM}), introduced by the authors, can be utilized to identify the stability regime of a given flow pattern, besides distinguishing between different flow systems. The potential of the Euler characteristic surface and the Euler metric have been demonstrated first on analyzing a simulated deterministic dynamical system before being applied to analyze experimental flow patterns that develop in micrometer sized drying droplets.},
