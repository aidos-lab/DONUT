 abstract = {The Topological Data Analysis ({TDA}) has had many applications. However, financial markets has been studied slightly through {TDA}. Here we present a quick review of some recent applications of {TDA} on financial markets and propose a new turbulence index based on persistent homology -- the fundamental tool for {TDA} -- that seems to capture critical transitions on financial data, based on our experiment with {SP}500 data before 2020 stock market crash in February 20, 2020, due to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We review applications in the early detection of turbulence periods in financial markets and how {TDA} can help to get new insights while investing and obtain superior risk-adjusted returns compared with investing strategies using classical turbulence indices as {VIX} and the Chow's index based on the Mahalanobis distance. Furthermore, we include an introduction to persistent homology so the reader could be able to understand this paper without knowing {TDA}.},
