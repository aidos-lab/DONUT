 abstract = {The detection and grading of fibrosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms ({MPN}) is an important component of disease classification, prognostication and disease monitoring. However, current fibrosis grading systems are only semi-quantitative and fail to capture sample heterogeneity. To improve the detection, quantitation and representation of reticulin fibrosis, we developed a machine learning ({ML}) approach using bone marrow trephine ({BMT}) samples (n = 107) from patients diagnosed with {MPN} or a reactive / nonneoplastic marrow. The resulting Continuous Indexing of Fibrosis ({CIF}) enhances the detection and monitoring of fibrosis within {BMTs}, and aids the discrimination of {MPN} subtypes. When combined with megakaryocyte feature analysis, {CIF} discriminates between the frequently challenging differential diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia ({ET}) and pre-fibrotic myelofibrosis (pre-{PMF}) with high predictive accuracy [area under the curve = 0.94]. {CIF} also shows significant promise in the identification of {MPN} patients at risk of disease progression; analysis of samples from 35 patients diagnosed with {ET} and enrolled in the Primary Thrombocythemia-1 ({PT}-1) trial identified features predictive of post-{ET} myelofibrosis (area under the curve = 0.77). In addition to these clinical applications, automated analysis of fibrosis has clear potential to further refine disease classification boundaries and inform future studies of the micro-environmental factors driving disease initiation and progression in {MPN} and other stem cell disorders. The image analysis methods used to generate {CIF} can be readily integrated with those of other key morphological features in {MPNs}, including megakaryocyte morphology, that lie beyond the scope of conventional histological assessment.
Key {PointsMachine} learning enables an objective and quantitative description of reticulin fibrosis within the bone marrow of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms ({MPN}),Automated analysis and Continuous Indexing of Fibrosis ({CIF}) captures heterogeneity within {MPN} samples and has utility in refined classification and disease {monitoringQuantitative} fibrosis assessment combined with topological data analysis may help to predict patients at increased risk of progression to post-{ET} myelofibrosis, and assist in the discrimination of {ET} and pre-fibrotic {PMF} (pre-{PMF})},
