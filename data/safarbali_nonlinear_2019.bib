 abstract = {In recent years, atrial fibrillation ({AF}) development from paroxysmal to persistent or permanent forms has become an important issue in cardiovascular disorders. Information about {AF} pattern of presentation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) was useful in the management of algorithms in each category. This management is aimed at reducing symptoms and stopping severe problems associated with {AF}. {AF} classification has been based on time duration and episodes until now. In particular, complexity changes in Heart Rate Variation ({HRV}) may contain clinically relevant signals of imminent systemic dysregulation. A number of nonlinear methods based on phase space and topological properties can give more insight into {HRV} abnormalities such as fibrillation. Aiming to provide a nonlinear tool to qualitatively classify {AF} stages, we proposed two geometrical indices (fractal dimension and persistent homology) based on {HRV} phase space, which can successfully replicate the changes in {AF} progression. The study population includes 38 lone {AF} patients and 20 normal subjects, which are collected from the Physio-Bank database. “Time of Life ({TOL})” is proposed as a new feature based on the initial and final Čech radius in the persistent homology diagram. A neural network was implemented to prove the effectiveness of both {TOL} and fractal dimension as classification features. The accuracy of classification performance was 93\%. The proposed indices provide a signal representation framework useful to understand the dynamic changes in {AF} cardiac patterns and to classify normal and pathological rhythms.},
