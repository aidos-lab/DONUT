 abstract = {Biological networks consist of functional modules, however detecting and characterizing such modules in networks remains challenging. Perturbing networks is one strategy for identifying modules. Here we used an advanced mathematical approach named topological data analysis ({TDA}) to interrogate two perturbed networks. In one, we disrupted the S. cerevisiae {INO}80 protein interaction network by isolating complexes after protein complex components were deleted from the genome. In the second, we reanalyzed previously published data demonstrating the disruption of the human Sin3 network with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Here we show that disrupted networks contained topological network modules ({TNMs}) with shared properties that mapped onto distinct locations in networks. We define {TMNs} as proteins that occupy close network positions depending on their coordinates in a topological space. {TNMs} provide new insight into networks by capturing proteins from different categories including proteins within a complex, proteins with shared biological functions, and proteins disrupted across networks.},
