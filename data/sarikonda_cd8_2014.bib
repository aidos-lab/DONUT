 abstract = {Previous cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that {CD}8+ and {CD}4+ T-cell reactivity to islet-specific antigens was more prevalent in T1D subjects than in healthy donors ({HD}). Here, we examined T1D-associated epitope-specific {CD}4+ T-cell cytokine production and autoreactive {CD}8+ T-cell frequency on a monthly basis for one year in 10 {HD}, 33 subjects with T1D, and 15 subjects with T2D. Autoreactive {CD}4+ T-cells from both T1D and T2D subjects produced more {IFN}-Î³ when stimulated than cells from {HD}. In contrast, higher frequencies of islet antigen-specific {CD}8+ T-cells were detected only in T1D. These observations support the hypothesis that general beta-cell stress drives autoreactive {CD}4+ T-cell activity while islet over-expression of {MHC} class I commonly seen in T1D mediates amplification of {CD}8+ T-cells and more rapid beta-cell loss. In conclusion, {CD}4+ T-cell autoreactivity appears to be present in both T1D and T2D while autoreactive {CD}8+ T-cells are unique to T1D. Thus, autoreactive {CD}8+ cells may serve as a more T1D-specific biomarker.},
