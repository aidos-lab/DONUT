 abstract = {Whereas knowledge of a crystalline material's unit cell is fundamental to understanding the material's properties and behavior, there are no obvious analogs to unit cells for disordered materials despite the frequent existence of considerable medium-range order. This article views a material's structure as a collection of local atomic environments that are sampled from some underlying probability distribution of such environments, with the advantage of offering a unified description of both ordered and disordered materials. Crystalline materials can then be regarded as special cases where the underlying probability distribution is highly concentrated around the traditional unit cell. The ùêª1 barcode is proposed as a descriptor of local atomic environments suitable for disordered bond networks and is applied with three other descriptors to molecular dynamics simulations of silica glasses. Each descriptor reliably distinguishes the structure of glasses produced at different cooling rates, with the ùêª1 barcode and coordination profile providing the best separation. The approach is generally applicable to any system that can be represented as a sparse graph.},
