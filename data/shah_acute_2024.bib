 abstract = {Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ({ALL}) is a prevalent form of childhood blood cancer characterized by the proliferation of immature white blood cells that rapidly replace normal cells in the bone marrow. The exponential growth of these leukemic cells can be fatal if not treated promptly. Classifying lymphoblasts and healthy cells poses a significant challenge, even for domain experts, due to their morphological similarities. Automated computer analysis of {ALL} can provide substantial support in this domain and potentially save numerous lives. In this paper, we propose a novel classification approach that involves analyzing shapes and extracting topological features of {ALL} cells. We employ persistent homology to capture these topological features. Our technique accurately and efficiently detects and classifies leukemia blast cells, achieving a recall of 98.2\% and an F1-score of 94.6\%. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance leukemia diagnosis and therapy.},
