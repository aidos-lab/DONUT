 abstract = {The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis ({TDA}), called extended persistent homology ({EPH}), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using {EPH}-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. {EPH} captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using {TDA} tools such as {EPH} can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems.},
