 abstract = {Background
Asthma is a complex chronic disease underpinned by pathological changes within the airway wall. How variations in structural airway pathology and cellular inflammation contribute to the expression and severity of asthma are poorly understood.
Objectives
Therefore we evaluated pathological heterogeneity using topological data analysis ({TDA}) with the aim of visualizing disease clusters and microclusters.
Methods
A discovery population of 202 adult patients (142 asthmatic patients and 60 healthy subjects) and an external replication population (59 patients with severe asthma) were evaluated. Pathology and gene expression were examined in bronchial biopsy samples. {TDA} was applied by using pathological variables alone to create pathology-driven visual networks.
Results
In the discovery cohort {TDA} identified 4 groups/networks with multiple microclusters/regions of interest that were masked by group-level statistics. Specifically, {TDA} group 1 consisted of a high proportion of healthy subjects, with a microcluster representing a topological continuum connecting healthy subjects to patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. Three additional {TDA} groups with moderate-to-severe asthma (Airway Smooth {MuscleHigh}, Reticular Basement {MembraneHigh}, and {RemodelingLow} groups) were identified and contained numerous microclusters with varying pathological and clinical features. Mutually exclusive {TH}2 and {TH}17 tissue gene expression signatures were identified in all pathological groups. Discovery and external replication applied to the severe asthma subgroup identified only highly similar “pathological data shapes” through analyses of persistent homology.
Conclusions
We have identified and replicated novel pathological phenotypes of asthma using {TDA}. Our methodology is applicable to other complex chronic diseases.},
