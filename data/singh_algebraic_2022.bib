 abstract = {Primary sclerosing cholangitis ({PSC}) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. However, predicting future outcomes in patients with {PSC} is challenging. Our aim was to extract magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) features that predict the development of hepatic decompensation by applying algebraic topology-based machine learning ({ML}).},
