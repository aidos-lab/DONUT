 abstract = {To provide accurate predictions, current machine learning-based solutions require large, manually labeled training datasets. We implement persistent homology ({PH}), a topological tool for studying the pattern of data, to analyze echocardiography-based strain data and differentiate between rare diseases like constrictive pericarditis ({CP}) and restrictive cardiomyopathy ({RCM}). Patient population (retrospectively registered) included those presenting with heart failure due to {CP} (n = 51), {RCM} (n = 47), and patients without heart failure symptoms (n = 53). Longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strains/strain rates for left ventricular segments were processed into topological feature vectors using Machine learning {PH} workflow. In differentiating {CP} and {RCM}, the {PH} workflow model had a {ROC} {AUC} of 0.94 (Sensitivity = 92\%, Specificity = 81\%), compared with the {GLS} model {AUC} of 0.69 (Sensitivity = 65\%, Specificity = 66\%). In differentiating between all three conditions, the {PH} workflow model had an {AUC} of 0.83 (Sensitivity = 68\%, Specificity = 84\%), compared with the {GLS} model {AUC} of 0.68 (Sensitivity = 52\% and Specificity = 76\%). By employing persistent homology to differentiate the “pattern” of cardiac deformations, our machine-learning approach provides reasonable accuracy when evaluating small datasets and aids in understanding and visualizing patterns of cardiac imaging data in clinically challenging disease states.},
