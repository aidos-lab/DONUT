 abstract = {Topological features such as persistence diagrams and their functional approximations like persistence images ({PIs}) have been showing substantial promise for machine learning and computer vision applications. This is greatly attributed to the robustness topological representations provide against different types of physical nuisance variables seen in real-world data, such as view-point, illumination, and more. However, key bottlenecks to their large scale adoption are computational expenditure and difﬁculty incorporating them in a differentiable architecture. We take an important step in this paper to mitigate these bottlenecks by proposing a novel one-step approach to generate {PIs} directly from the input data. We design two separate convolutional neural network architectures, one designed to take in multi-variate time series signals as input and another that accepts multi-channel images as input. We call these networks Signal {PI}-Net and Image {PINet} respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to propose the use of deep learning for computing topological features directly from data. We explore the use of the proposed {PI}-Net architectures on two applications: human activity recognition using tri-axial accelerometer sensor data and image classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the ease of fusion of {PIs} in supervised deep learning architectures and speed up of several orders of magnitude for extracting {PIs} from data.
