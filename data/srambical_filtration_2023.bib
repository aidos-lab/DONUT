 abstract = {Existing approaches for classifying dynamic graphs either lift graph kernels to the temporal domain, or use graph neural networks ({GNNs}). However, current baselines have scalability issues, cannot handle a changing node set, or do not take edge weight information into account. We propose filtration surfaces, a novel method that is scalable and flexible, to alleviate said restrictions. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our model and show that filtration surfaces outperform previous state-of-the-art baselines on datasets that rely on edge weight information. Our method does so while being either completely parameter-free or having at most one parameter, and yielding the lowest overall standard deviation among similarly scalable methods.},
