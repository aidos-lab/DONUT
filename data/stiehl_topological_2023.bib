 abstract = {A new topology based feature extraction method for classification of interictal epileptiform discharges ({IEDs}) in {EEG} recordings from patients with epilepsy is proposed. After dimension reduction of the recorded {EEG} signal, using dynamical component analysis ({DyCA}) or principal component analysis ({PCA}), a persistent homology analysis of the resulting phase space trajectories is performed. Features are extracted from the persistent homology analysis and used to train and evaluate a support vector machine ({SVM}). Classification results based on these persistent features are compared with statistical features of the dimension-reduced signals and combinations of all of these features. Combining the persistent and statistical features improves the results (accuracy 94.7 \%) compared to using only statistical feature extraction, whereas applying only persistent features does not achieve sufficient performance. For this classification example the choice of the dimension reduction technique does not significantly influence the classification performance of the algorithm.},
