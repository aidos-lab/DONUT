 abstract = {Flood early warning systems ({FLEWSs}) contribute remarkably to reducing economic and life losses during a flood. The theory of critical slowing down ({CSD}) has been successfully used as a generic indicator of early warning signals in various fields. A new tool called persistent homology ({PH}) was recently introduced for data analysis. {PH} employs a qualitative approach to assess a data set and provide new information on the topological features of the data set. In the present paper, we propose the use of {PH} as a preprocessing step to achieve a {FLEWS} through {CSD}. We test our proposal on water level data of the Kelantan River, which tends to flood nearly every year. The results suggest that the new information obtained by {PH} exhibits {CSD} and, therefore, can be used as a signal for a {FLEWS}. Further analysis of the signal, we manage to establish an early warning signal for ten of the twelve flood events recorded in the river; the two other events are detected on the first day of the flood. Finally, we compare our results with those of a {FLEWS} constructed directly from water level data and find that {FLEWS} via {PH} creates fewer false alarms than the conventional technique.},
