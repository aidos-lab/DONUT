 abstract = {Changes in the parameters of dynamical systems can cause the state of the system to shift between different qualitative regimes. These shifts, known as bifurcations, are critical to study as they can indicate when the system is about to undergo harmful changes in its behavior. In stochastic dynamical systems, there is particular interest in P-type (phenomenological) bifurcations, which can include transitions from a monostable state to multi-stable states, the appearance of stochastic limit cycles and other features in the probability density function ({PDF}) of the system’s state. Current practices are limited to systems with small state spaces, cannot detect all possible behaviors of the {PDFs} and mandate human intervention for visually identifying the change in the {PDF}. In contrast, this study presents a new approach based on Topological Data Analysis that uses superlevel persistence to mathematically quantify P-type bifurcations in stochastic systems through a “homological bifurcation plot”—which shows the changing ranks of 0th and 1st homology groups, through Betti vectors. Using these plots, we demonstrate the successful detection of P-bifurcations on the stochastic Duffing, Raleigh-Vander Pol and Quintic Oscillators given their analytical {PDFs}, and elaborate on how to generate an estimated homological bifurcation plot given a kernel density estimate ({KDE}) of these systems by employing a tool for finding topological consistency between {PDFs} and {KDEs}.},
