 abstract = {Background Sonographic risk patterns identified in established risk stratification systems ({RSS}) may not accurately stratify follicular carcinoma from adenoma, which share many similar {US} characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a multimodal machine learning model utilizing radiomics and topological data analysis ({TDA}) to predict malignancy in follicular thyroid neoplasms on ultrasound. Patients \& Methods This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent thyroidectomy with pathology confirmed follicular adenoma or carcinoma at a single academic medical center between 2010 and 2022. Features derived from radiomics and {TDA} were calculated from processed ultrasound images and high-dimensional features in each modality were projected onto their first two principal components. Logistic regression with L2 penalty was used to predict malignancy and performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation and area under the curve ({AUC}). Results Patients with follicular adenomas (n = 7) and follicular carcinomas (n = 11) with available imaging were included. The best multimodal model achieved an {AUC} of 0.88 (95\% {CI}: [0.85, 1]), whereas the best radiomics model achieved an {AUC} of 0.68 (95\% {CI}: [0.61, 0.84]). Conclusions We demonstrate that inclusion of topological features yields strong improvement over radiomics-based features alone in the prediction of follicular carcinoma on ultrasound. Despite low volume data, the {TDA} features explicitly capture shape information that likely augments performance of the multimodal machine learning model. This approach suggests that a quantitative based {US} {RSS} may contribute to the preoperative prediction of follicular carcinoma.},
