 abstract = {The diurnal cycle of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) is a daily cycle in clouds that appears in satellite images and may have implications for {TC} structure and intensity. The diurnal pattern can be seen in infrared ({IR}) satellite imagery as cyclical pulses in the cloud field that propagate radially outward from the center of nearly all Atlantic-basin {TCs}. These diurnal pulses, a distinguishing characteristic of this diurnal cycle, begin forming in the stormâ€™s inner core near sunset each day, appearing as a region of cooling cloud-top temperatures. The area of cooling takes on a ring-like appearance as cloud-top warming occurs on its inside edge and the cooling moves away from the storm overnight, reaching several hundred kilometers from the circulation center by the following afternoon. The state-of-the-art {TC} diurnal cycle measurement in {IR} satellite imagery has a limited ability to analyze the behavior beyond qualitative observations. We present a method for quantifying the {TC} diurnal cycle using one-dimensional persistent homology, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, by tracking maximum persistence and quantifying the cycle using the discrete Fourier transform. Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite {IR} imagery from Hurricanes Felix and Ivan, our method is able to detect an approximate daily cycle.},
