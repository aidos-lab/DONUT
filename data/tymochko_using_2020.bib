 abstract = {Bifurcations in dynamical systems characterize qualitative changes in the system behavior. Therefore, their detection is important because they can signal the transition from normal system operation to imminent failure. While standard persistent homology has been used in this setting, it usually requires analyzing a collection of persistence diagrams, which in turn drives up the computational cost considerably. Using zigzag persistence, we can capture topological changes in the state space of the dynamical system in only one persistence diagram. Here we present Bifurcations using {ZigZag} ({BuZZ}), a one-step method to study and detect bifurcations using zigzag persistence. The {BuZZ} method is successfully able to detect this type of behavior in two synthetic examples as well as an example dynamical system.},
