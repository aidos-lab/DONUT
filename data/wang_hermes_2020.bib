 abstract = {Persistent homology ({PH}) is one of the most popular tools in topological data analysis ({TDA}), while graph theory has had a significant impact on data science. Our earlier work introduced the persistent spectral graph ({PSG}) theory as a unified multiscale paradigm to encompass {TDA} and geometric analysis. In {PSG} theory, families of persistent Laplacians ({PLs}) corresponding to various topological dimensions are constructed via a filtration to sample a given dataset at multiple scales. The harmonic spectra from the null spaces of {PLs} offer the same topological invariants, namely persistent Betti numbers, at various dimensions as those provided by {PH}, while the non-harmonic spectra of {PLs} give rise to additional geometric analysis of the shape of the data. In this work, we develop an open-source software package, called highly efficient robust multidimensional evolutionary spectra ({HERMES}), to enable broad applications of {PSGs} in science, engineering, and technology. To ensure the reliability and robustness of {HERMES}, we have validated the software with simple geometric shapes and complex datasets from three-dimensional (3D) protein structures. We found that the smallest non-zero eigenvalues are very sensitive to data abnormality.},
