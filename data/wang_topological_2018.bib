 abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that can negatively affect the visual, audial and motor functions of the human brain. Statistical analysis of neurophysiological recordings, such as electroencephalogram ({EEG}), facilitates the understanding and diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Standard statistical methods, however, do not account for topological features embedded in {EEG} signals. In the current study, we propose a persistent homology ({PH}) procedure to analyze single-trial {EEG} signals. The procedure denoises signals with a weighted Fourier series ({WFS}), and tests for topological difference between the denoised signals with a permutation test based on their {PH} features persistence landscapes ({PL}). Simulation studies show that the test effectively identifies topological difference and invariance between two signals. In an application to a single-trial multichannel seizure {EEG} dataset, our proposed {PH} procedure was able to identify the left temporal region to consistently show topological invariance, suggesting that the {PH} features of the Fourier decomposition during seizure is similar to the process before seizure. This finding is important because it could not be identified from a mere visual inspection of the {EEG} data and was in fact missed by earlier analyses of the same dataset.},
