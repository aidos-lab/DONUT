 abstract = {Large-amplitude chatter vibrations are one of the most important phenomena in machining processes. It is often detrimental in cutting operations causing a poor surface finish and decreased tool life. Therefore, chatter detection using machine learning has been an active research area over the last decade. Three challenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection at large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of chatter features across different processes, the need for automating feature extraction, and the existence of limited data for each specific workpiece-machine tool combination, e.g., when machining one-off products. These three challenges can be grouped under the umbrella of transfer learning, which is concerned with studying how knowledge gained from one setting can be leveraged to obtain information in new settings. This paper studies automating chatter detection by evaluating transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter detection methods. We investigate chatter classification accuracy using a variety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments with different cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}), Power Spectral Density ({PSD}), the Auto-correlation Function ({ACF}), and decomposition based tools such as Wavelet Packet Transform ({WPT}) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition ({EEMD}). We also examine more recent approaches based on Topological Data Analysis ({TDA}) and similarity measures of time series based on Discrete Time Warping ({DTW}). We evaluate transfer learning potential of each approach by training and testing both within and across the turning and milling data sets. Four supervised classification algorithms are explored: support vector machine ({SVM}), logistic regression, random forest classification, and gradient boosting. In addition to accuracy, we also comment on the automation potential of feature extraction for each approach which is integral to creating autonomous manufacturing centers. Our results show that carefully chosen time-frequency features can lead to high classification accuracies albeit at the cost of requiring manual pre-processing and the tagging of an expert user. On the other hand, we found that the {TDA} and {DTW} approaches can provide accuracies and F1-scores on par with the time-frequency methods without the need for manual preprocessing via completely automatic pipelines. Further, we discovered that the {DTW} approach outperforms all other methods when trained using the milling data and tested on the turning data. Therefore, {TDA} and {DTW} approaches may be preferred over the time-frequency-based approaches for fully automated chatter detection schemes. {DTW} and {TDA} also can be more advantageous when pooling data from either limited workpiece-machine tool combinations, or from small data sets of one-off processes.},
