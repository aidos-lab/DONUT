 abstract = {Cortical interneurons originating from the medial ganglionic eminence, {MGE}, are among the most diverse cells within the {CNS}. Different pools of proliferating progenitor cells are thought to exist in the ventricular zone of the {MGE}, but whether the underlying subventricular and mantle regions of the {MGE} are spatially patterned has not yet been addressed. Here, we combined laser-capture microdissection and multiplex {RNA}-sequencing to map the transcriptome of {MGE} cells at a spatial resolution of 50 μm.},
